# Perpetual-Motion
This repository investigates the idea of perpetual motion â€” machines that, once set in motion, continue indefinitely without energy input or loss.

The work does not assume feasibility. Instead, it explores boundary conditions, theoretical loopholes, energy transfer models, and mechanical behaviors that challenge or reaffirm the current understanding of thermodynamics.

This is a study in physical logic, not a claim of violation. If the laws hold, the failure must be shown in the system. If they break, it must be shown through repeatable structure.


### Scope

- Reviewing classical definitions: PMM-1, PMM-2, PMM-3  
- Isolating where losses occur in real systems  
- Rebuilding hypothetical setups with revised logic  
- Analyzing idealized motion and conserved systems  
- Exploring symmetry, feedback, and structural energy flow
